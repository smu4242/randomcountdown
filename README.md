# randomcountdown

Inspired by futuramas "random number countdown".

Displays a fake countdown, that only looks like it's counting down.
But really, after a while it will reset to a random value.

You can use it with a specified initial time:
https://smu4242.github.io/randomcountdown/countdown.html?t=35
Reset will happen after a random time that is <= t/2.
Note that t should be 1 <= t <= 59, otherwise it might look odd.

For even more randomness:

Reset will happen after a random time that is <= t.

Intended to be used for twitch brb screens (when you really don't know how long you need).
